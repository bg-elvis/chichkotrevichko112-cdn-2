As a result, they are incurring penalty fees from HENEX, which is causing significant problems for them.\n\n \n\nIt's imperative that we make this deposit as soon as possible to prevent any strain on our relationship with Eurobank.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, I propose that we deposit an amount of €500 to fulfill our obligations for the next four months. This proactive step will help us avoid similar issues in the future.\n\n \n\nGiven that we are currently overdue by 7 days, I urge you to prioritize this matter and take immediate action.\n\n \n\nBest regards,\n\nThanasis","subject":"FW: Urgent: Deposit Required to Avoid Penalty Fees from Eurobank","date":"2024-03-07T15:09:54.000Z","to":[{"address":"","name":"ТИБИЕЛ ЕООД"}],"attachmentsData":[]}
